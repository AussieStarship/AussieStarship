- ðŸ‘‹Hi, Iâ€™m @AussieStarship, a retired mechanical engineer, very much into personal DIY projects.
I've had PCs and laptops on my boats since the late 1980's, and played with Visual Basic, and PIC microprocessors about 20 year back.
Only recently, coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic, two projects have drawn me into coding for Arduino R3, and a WiFi dual ATMEGA/ESP 8266.
So, fascinating though it all is, and rewarding (as learning something new always is), my coding is focussed on the specific needs of my projects, rather than any pretence at becoming "proficient" as a programmer!
